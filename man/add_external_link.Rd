\title{Add external links to a DataStore reference}
\usage{
add_external_link(
  reference_id,
  url,
  description,
  last_verified = format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y-\%m-\%d"),
  dev = TRUE,
  interactive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference_id}{Numeric reference ID. You must have the appropriate permissions to edit this reference.}

\item{url}{The full URL you wish to add as an external link. Web URLs must start with "https://".}

\item{description}{A description of the external link.}

\item{last_verified}{Character. The date in ISO 8601 format (e.g. "2025-07-21") when the URL was last verified to be correct and working. You can almost always allow this to default to the current date.}

\item{dev}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE because it's best to attempt to modify references on the development & testing version of DataStore first. When everything is working, change to \code{dev = FALSE} and run again to edit the real reference.}

\item{interactive}{Logical. Prompt for user confirmation before uploading?}
}

A list of information about the link that was added
