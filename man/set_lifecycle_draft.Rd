\title{Set a reference to draft mode}
\usage{
set_lifecycle_draft(reference_id, dev = TRUE, interactive = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference_id}{Numeric reference ID. You must have the appropriate permissions to edit this reference.}

\item{dev}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE because it's best to attempt to modify references on the development & testing version of DataStore first. When everything is working, change to \code{dev = FALSE} and run again to edit the real reference.}

\item{interactive}{Logical. Prompt for user confirmation before uploading?}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the current lifecycle information for the reference
}
\description{
Use with extreme caution! You may not be able to reactivate via the API if you are working with an older reference that is missing multiple required fields.
