\usage{
delete_reference_owner(
  reference_id,
  upn,
  email,
  dev = TRUE,
  interactive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference_id}{Numeric reference ID. You must have the appropriate permissions to edit this reference.}

\item{upn}{A single user's UPN. Must specify either \code{upn} or \code{email} but not both.}

\item{email}{A single user's email. Must specify either \code{upn} or \code{email} but not both.}

\item{dev}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE because it's best to attempt to modify references on the development & testing version of DataStore first. When everything is working, change to \code{dev = FALSE} and run again to edit the real reference.}

\item{interactive}{Logical. Prompt for user confirmation before uploading?}
}
